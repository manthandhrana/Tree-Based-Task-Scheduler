# Task Scheduler Tree - minRounds

This is a JavaScript (Node.js) solution to calculate the **minimum number of rounds** required to complete all tasks in a tree-like dependency structure, where each task can only be done after its parent and up to `K` tasks can be executed in parallel in a round.

---

## Problem Description

- You are given:
  - `N`: Number of tasks (numbered from 1 to N)
  - `edges`: A list of `[parent, child]` pairs (tree edges showing dependency)
  - `K`: Maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel per round
- A task can only be executed after its parent is completed.
- The goal is to calculate the **minimum number of rounds** needed.
